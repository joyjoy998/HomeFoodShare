# [Home Food Share](https://github.com/joyjoy998/HomeFoodShare)

## Inspiration
At university we are surrounded by students from diverse cultural backgrounds, each with unique culinary traditions. However, in the busy academic life, many students rarely have the chance to connect beyond their immediate social circles or experience the rich culinary diversity that exists within our campus community. The inspiration for our HomeFoodShare project stemmed from a simple idea: what if we could bridge these cultural divides through something as universally loved as food? By creating a platform where students can share their homemade dishes and connect over a shared love for food, we aim to foster cross-cultural friendships and promote a greater sense of community within our university.

## What it does
HomeFoodShare is a dynamic platform tailored for uni students to share and experience homemade, authentic dishes from around the world. Students can post about the dishes they've prepared, highlighting the cultural significance and ingredients involved. Other students can comment on these posts, expressing their interest in trying the dish or simply appreciating the culinary effort. The platform facilitates offline meetups where students can connect in person, share their food, and enjoy meaningful cross-cultural exchanges. It's more than just a food-sharing app; it's a community-building tool that promotes friendship and cultural understanding.

## How we built it
- We built HomeFoodShare with a clear focus on simplicity, performance, and scalability. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface that adapts seamlessly across various devices. 
- To design an intuitive and visually appealing user experience, we utilized Figma for UI design, which allowed us to prototype and refine the interface efficiently.
- On the backend, we leveraged AWS services to manage the core functionalities of the platform. An AWS database was used to store and manage user data, posts, and comments effectively. The communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated by AWS API, ensuring secure and reliable data exchange. Additionally, we implemented AWS Lambda functions, written in Node.js, to handle specific backend tasks such as user authentication, post management, and real-time interactions. This serverless architecture enables the platform to scale effortlessly as it grows, maintaining performance and reliability.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Limited Experience and Time Constraints:** With only a year of coding experience among all team members, completing the integration of all functionalities within the limited 24-hour timeframe presented significant technical challenges, even for a minimum viable product (MVP).
- **UI and Code Integration:** The integration of the UI design with the backend code led to various bugs, complicating the development process and requiring additional debugging efforts.
- **Address Privacy and Food Safety:** Ensuring the privacy of users' addresses and addressing concerns around food safety were critical issues that required careful consideration and added complexity to the platform's design.
- **Storing User Profile Pictures:** We encountered a specific challenge when trying to convert and store user profile pictures as JSON data in the database during the sign-up process, which required us to explore alternative solutions to manage this data effectively.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **We Completed It!** Despite the many challenges, we successfully completed the HomeFoodShare project within the given timeframe.
- **Innovation Through Connection:** We are proud of how we innovatively connected people from different cultural backgrounds through the universal love of food. This platform not only creates a warm and welcoming space for sharing good food but also sparks meaningful conversations and connections among students.
- **Fun and Engaging Interface:** The gamified design of our interface is something we're particularly proud of. We created a fun and interactive user experience that keeps users engaged and makes the platform enjoyable to use.
- **Overcoming UI Challenges:** Although we faced significant challenges in bringing our imaginative UI design to life, especially with our limited experience, we were able to realize over 90% of our original vision. This accomplishment is a testament to our determination and problem-solving skills.
- **Perfect Team Collaboration:** Our teamâ€™s ability to collaborate effectively was one of our greatest strengths. Even when conflicts arose, we were able to resolve them peacefully and maintain a positive and productive working environment throughout the project

## What we learned
- **Importance of Experience and Time Management:** The challenges we faced with our limited coding experience and the tight 24-hour timeframe taught us the importance of proper time management and the need for continuous learning. We realized how crucial it is to plan efficiently and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines, especially in a high-pressure environment.
- **Thorough Testing and Debugging:** The bugs encountered during the integration of UI and code emphasized the importance of thorough testing and debugging at every stage of development. We learned that close collaboration between the design and development teams is essential to ensure a smooth integration process.
- **Addressing Privacy and Safety:** The challenges surrounding address privacy and food safety highlighted the need for strong data protection measures and careful consideration of user safety. We gained valuable insights into implementing security features that protect user information and ensure a safe platform experience.
- **Handling Complex Data Storage:** The difficulty in converting and storing user profile pictures as JSON data taught us the importance of choosing the right data storage formats and tools. We learned how to adapt and find alternative solutions to manage complex data types effectively, which will be beneficial for future projects.
- **Understanding the Full Development Process:** Through this project, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the entire development process and the various challenges that can arise. We learned that thinking from a developer's perspective is significantly different from a user's perspective, which has given us valuable insights that will greatly benefit our approach to future IT projects.

## What's next for HomeFoodShare
- **Complete Front-End and Back-End Interaction:** Our next step is to ensure seamless and comprehensive interaction between the front-end and back-end, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of the platform.
- **Unify Design Style:** We plan to unify the design style across all elements of the website to create a consistent and cohesive visual experience for our users.
- **Implement In-Site Notifications for Comments:** We will introduce in-site notifications to alert users when they receive comments on their posts, making it easier for them to stay engaged with the community and respond promptly to interactions.
