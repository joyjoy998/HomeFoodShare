# Home Food Share

## Inspiration
At university we are surrounded by students from diverse cultural backgrounds, each with unique culinary traditions. However, in the busy academic life, many students rarely have the chance to connect beyond their immediate social circles or experience the rich culinary diversity that exists within our campus community. The inspiration for our HomeFoodShare project stemmed from a simple idea: what if we could bridge these cultural divides through something as universally loved as food? By creating a platform where students can share their homemade dishes and connect over a shared love for food, we aim to foster cross-cultural friendships and promote a greater sense of community within our university.

## What it does
HomeFoodShare is a dynamic platform tailored for uni students to share and experience homemade, authentic dishes from around the world. Students can post about the dishes they've prepared, highlighting the cultural significance and ingredients involved. Other students can comment on these posts, expressing their interest in trying the dish or simply appreciating the culinary effort. The platform facilitates offline meetups where students can connect in person, share their food, and enjoy meaningful cross-cultural exchanges. It's more than just a food-sharing app; it's a community-building tool that promotes friendship and cultural understanding.
